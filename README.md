# TimeFlow
The TimeFlow is a React.js project that provides a simple and intuitive way to manage your work and break sessions. This timer follows the popular Pomodoro technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. The timer allows you to customize the session and break lengths according to your preferences.
